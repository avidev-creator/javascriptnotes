/* 
1. So const can not be changed.
2. DO NOT USE VAR as there is an issue in javascript with Block and Functional Scope.
3. We can reserve a variable without giving any datatype to it in javascript. This must be avoided and that's why TYPESCRIPT arrived.
4. A variable which is only declared but not defined will give you "UNDEFINED".
